# tictactoe_app

Date: January 2018 - June 2018

An app created using Android Studio in Java. It is a Tic-Tac-Toe app with a menu and main game screens.

My goals of this project were:

1. trying to make an android app
2. practice using Android studios
3. experiementing with multiple screens and buttons

This app contains such as:

1. customization menus:
   - computer opponent on/off
   - name customization
   - who goes first
2. buttons with Tic Tac Toe rules and checking

Things to improve:

1. computer logic to make it a challenge
2. bug fixing with exiting the app screen
